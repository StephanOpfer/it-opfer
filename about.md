Hi, my name is Stephan Opfer. I am a computer scientist and software engineer working at [Micromata](https://www.micromata.de). I have ~14 years of experience in the area of robotics and artificial intelligence and recently finished my PhD. Afterwards, I switched from robotics to web-based applications, in order to broaden my knowledge about big-data and cloud technologies.
